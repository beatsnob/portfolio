                <p>The transition to web development and programming is definitely a change from the work I was in previously. While the fields I was engaged with still interest and challenge me (my formal education is in psychology and behavioural science with a masters degree in human nutrition), I was looking for a creative outlet where I can be myself through expressive and thoughtful design.
                    But I wasn’t about to splash paint around in my garage! As I straddle what is commonly known as ‘type A’ and ‘type C’ personalities, I needed structure to organise and plan the creative process in a logical and meaningful way. This is when I discovered that web development and design would be the perfect medium. I am passionate about creating beautiful, user-friendly, accessible and modern websites and platforms that seamlessly incorporate intelligent design, to bring thought-provoking ideas to the world.
